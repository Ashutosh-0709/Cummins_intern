## Premise

During my internship at Cummins India Limited, I conducted an observational study of the manufacturing and assembly processes involved in engine production. My focus was on understanding the production flow, analyzing machining operations like milling and boring, and assessing assembly line workflows, tools, and ergonomic considerations. Through this experience, I gained valuable insights into how manufacturing techniques and assembly processes contribute to overall operational efficiency and quality control in a large-scale industrial setting.
